     [GitHub::CreateRelease]
     repo = github_repo_name         ; optional
     branch = main                   ; default = main

     title_template = Version RELEASE - TRIAL CPAN release      ; this is the default

DESCRIPTION
    This plugin will create a GitHub Release and attach a copy of the cpan
    release archive to the Release.

    The release notes can be generated based on the notes_from value.

    This plugin should appear after any other AfterBuild plugin in your
    "dist.ini" file. If you are using SignReleaseNotes as the notes_from it
    should be after the SignReleaseNotes plugin.

Required Plugins
    This plugin requires that your Dist::Zilla configuration do the
    following:

     1. Create a release
     2. Tag the release in your git repository
     3. Push the commits (and tags) to GitHub

    There are numerous combinations of Dist::Zilla plugins that can perform
    those functions.

GITHUB API AUTHENTICATION
    This module uses Config::Identity::GitHub to access the GitHub API
    credentials.

    You need to create a file in your home directory named .github-identity.
    It requires the following fields:

     login github_username
     token github_....

    The GitHub API has a lot of options for the generation of Personal
    Access Tokens.

    At minimum you will need a personal access token with "Write" access to
    "Contents". It allows write access to Repository contents, commits,
    branches, downloads, releases, and merges.

    Config::Identity::GitHub supports a gpg encrypted .github-identity file.
    It is recommended that you implement encryption for the .github-identity
    file. If you have gpg configured you can encrypt the file:

     # Encrypt it to ~/.github-identity.asc
     gpg -ea -r you@example.com ~/.github-identity
     # Cat ~/.github-identity.asc to verify it is encrypted
     cat ~/.github-identity.asc
     # Verify you can decrypt the file
     gpg -d ~/.github-identity.asc
     # Replace the clear text version (uncomment next line)
     # mv ~/.github-identity.asc ~/.github-identity

ATTRIBUTES
    hash_alg
        A string value for the Digest::SHA supported hash algorithm to use
        for the hash of the cpan upload file.

    repo
        A string value that specifies the name of the github repository. The
        module determines the name based on the remote url but this setting
        can override the name that is detected.

    branch
        A string value that specifies the branch. It defaults to main if not
        specified.

    title_template
        A string value that specifies the format of the Title used for the
        release. If the title includes VERSION it is replaced with the
        version number of the release. If the title includes TRIAL it is
        replaced with Official or Trial depending on whether --trial was
        specified.

        The default value is "Version VERSION - TRIAL CPAN release"

    notes_as_code
        An integer value specifying true/false. If the value is true (not 0)
        the notes are surrounded by the github code markup "```" ... "```".

    github_notes
        An integer value specifying true/false. If the value is true (not 0)
        the api call instructs github to add a link to the changes in the
        release.

    notes_from
        A string value that specifies how to obtain the Notes for the
        Release. The valid values are:

        SignReleaseNotes
        ChangeLog
        FromFile
        GitHub::CreateRelease

    notes_file
        A string value specifying the name template of the notes file that
        should be read for to obtain the notes. It is used for if the
        note_from is one of:

         SignReleaseNotes
         FromFile
         ChangeLog

        The default is Release-VERSION and VERSION is replaced by the module
        version number if it exists.

    draft
        An integer value specifying true/false. If the value is true (not 0)
        the api call instructs github that the Release is a draft. You must
        publish it via the github webpage to make it active.

METHODS
    after_release
        The main processing function that is called automatically after the
        release is complete.

    true
        Boolean true constant

    false
        Boolean false constant
